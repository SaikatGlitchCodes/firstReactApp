# Getting started with Awesome React js ðŸ”¥

## What is React JS :
React JS is a Javascript Frontend Library for building single page Ui/Ux, with help of components, virtual dom.

## JSX : 
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage UI components in React applications. JSX is not required to use React, but it is widely adopted because it makes the code more readable and expressive.

### JSX Rules :
1. Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag || React.Fragement <> </> ---> React Fragment sugar form
2. like <img /> or <input /> must have a closing slash
3. { } to embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX
4. class ---> className
5. instead of style="background-color: red;", you would use style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }}.
6. JSX we follow kebab-case to camelCase

## Components : Special functions/class which return JSX
1. Component should start with Capital letter

## Transcompiler: 
1. complex javascript [ES6, JSX, Hooks, Virtual DOM] -- Trascompiler (Babel) -->  simple Js (Browser)
